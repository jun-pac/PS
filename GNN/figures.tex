    \caption{Graphical representation of functions $f$ and $g$. The shaded bars denote relative connectivity. Target node has label $y_i$, and only consider cases neighboring nodes with a labels $y_j$. The extent to which relative connectivity varies depending on the time difference is determined by the function $g(y_i,y_j,|t_j-t_i|)$, and its scale is adjusted by the function $f(y_i, t_i)$.}
